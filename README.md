# Shell of Former Self

I'm sure there are better ways to improve load time when starting a new terminal window/tab, but this is the solution I've been using. My .zshrc is probably bloated.

By sourcing index.zsh, and binding the new-tab script to a tmux binding, I can have a preloaded window that I swap to when I need to create a new session.

I'll improve documentation as I tweak this.
